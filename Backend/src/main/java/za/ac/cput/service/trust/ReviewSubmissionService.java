 ReviewSubmissionService.java

 Writing a review, with the rules that make a rating worth reading.

 A review may only be written by someone who actually completed a transaction
 with the person they are rating. Without that, ratings are just opinions from
 strangers and the Trusted Seller badge derived from them means nothing.

             as this.save(...). That does nothing at all - self-invocation never goes
