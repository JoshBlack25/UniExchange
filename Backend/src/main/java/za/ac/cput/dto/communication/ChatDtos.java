/*
 ChatDtos.java

 Request and response shapes for /api/chat.

 These are the one place in the backend that deliberately breaks the
 "controllers return raw entities" habit. Chat needs joined data the domain
 cannot express - the other participant's name, the last message in a thread, an
 unread count, a signed media URL - and there are no JPA relationships to walk.
 Returning entities here would force the frontend into a request per thread and
 a request per attachment.

 Grouped in one file because they are a single cohesive API contract; splitting
 six small records across six files would obscure rather than clarify.
